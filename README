stealth-medusa was written in order to run dictionary attacks against a domain's users
while never locking out any users. In order to do this you must know the lockout policy
threshold. You can easily get this most times by just querying domain controllers or 
other hosts.

You have to modify the values in the script and have medusa installed.

I included a basic userlist and small password dictionary. the dictionary is based upon 
the top discovered corporate passwords from Trustwave's Global Security Report. In my
own pentests, i have discovered these passwords to be prevalent. 

TODO:
-Add argument based script
-tell you ETA to next auth attempt
-instantly report on successful attempts
-instantly report on locked out accounts
